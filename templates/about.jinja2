    <h6>Hi! My name is: </h6>
   </br>
    <h1>Clara van Opdorp.</h1>
    <h1>I build things for the web.</h1>
    <div>I’m a Full stack developer and business analyst. I Build digital experiences. Currently focus on Freelance Projects.

    </br>
    <h6>I enjoy creating things that live on the internet.
      My interest in web development started back in 2020 when I was updating my business skills by learning python. — Turns out that learning how to access web data, fundamental programming concepts, data structures, networked application program interfaces and databases was just the begin.</br>
      </br>This showed me an infinite world of possibilities for designing and implementing solutions that will live on the internet. So I learned Html, Javascript, CSS and react while building some cool projects.</br>
      </br>
      I’m an Industrial Engineer with a decade of experience designing interdisciplinary systems and processes. The more mathematical and technical side of my background has always interested me most.
      Through the years, I’ve taught myself artificial intelligence. Now I work as a freelance software engineer.
